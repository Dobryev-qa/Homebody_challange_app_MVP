Act strictly on my instructions without adding features or assumptions.
Use Flutter (Dart), Clean Architecture, and BLoC by default.
Prefer offline-first solutions (Hive/SQLite); use Firebase only if I request it.
Write minimal, clean, production-ready code.
If something is unclear, implement the simplest possible solution.
